# eigenPLS
## A Simplified barebone Partial Least squares library

C++ PLS using the Eigen library: The algorithm was described by Herv√© Abdi. The Python implementation was done by Avinash Kak  [python implementation](https://engineering.purdue.edu/kak/distPLS/). A C++ implementation has already been performed using the cv2 matrix implementation. 

## Requirements 
This implementation uses the Eigen matrix library, which can theoretically be used for Arduino/ESP32 devices that already have the Eigen library. However, this code is not yet optimized for these devices.
