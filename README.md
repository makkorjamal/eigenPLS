# eigenPLS
## A Simplified barebone Partial Least squares library



C++ PLS using eigen library
The algorithm was described by Herve Abdi
Python implementation by Avinash Kak [python implementation](https://engineering.purdue.edu/kak/distPLS/)
A C++ implementation was already performed using cv2 matrix implemntation
This implementation uses Eigen matrix implementation which theoretically can be used for arduino/esp32
which have an eigen library already. This code is not yet optimized for these devices.
